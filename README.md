## A System and Method for Taking Attendance in Educational and Professional Settings

- Web Application for a Smart Attendance System based on Facial Recognition Method

## Project Description

- The system comprises a web user interface for uploading images of a classroom and running facial recognition techniques to keep a record of attendance digitally.
- A facial feature extraction processor for extracting facial features of the people after uploading multiple images.
- A network device for routing the images to the backend server and assessing facial recognition technique thereby extracting data from the image after uploading the image or a set of images on the client-side, wherein a machine learning technique is trained to find a plurality of specific points on any face.
- A central processor for obtaining a plurality of data points of each individual in the image and comparing the data points to a pre-maintained database of personal information.
- A rendering unit for rendering the results in form of a text file, wherein the record of attendance of every student present in the classroom is generated and assorted.
